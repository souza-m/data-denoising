Data Denoising via Optimal Transport - research project

This is the numerical implementation of a principal cuve with orthogonal noise and bounded curvature. If the curvatuere bound goes to zero, or equivalently, the penalization term goes grows arbitrarily, the solution exactly approximates the projection points in the PCA method. Details, theoretical support and additional examples will be published by June, 2024.
